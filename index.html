<div id="specialStyle">Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which</div> 
experienced surfers paddle into, or are towed into, 
waves which are at least 20 feet (6.2 m) high, 
on surf boards known as "guns" or towboards.

<hr>
<p>
<span style="color:red;">In 1992, big wave surfers such as Laird Hamilton and Darrick Doerner introduced</span>
a cross over sport called tow-in surfing.<br>[4] While many riders still participate 
in both sports, they remain very distinct activities. This type of surfing involves 
being towed into massive waves by jet ski, allowing for the speed needed to 
successfully ride. Tow in surfing also revolutionized board size, allowing surfers 
to trade in their unwieldy 12 ft.
